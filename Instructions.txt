Use "A" and "D" buttons to move the paddle and bounce ball back at the blocks.

Every "-" block broken out gives you 1 point.
Every "=" block broken out transforms to a "-" block.
Every "+" block broken out gives you 1 point and 1 bonus point.
On every 3 bonus points the paddle will become longer.

When you break all the blocks you will go to next level with 1 row more blocks.

When your ball is lost, you will see the "Game Over" window.

You can return to the main menu at any time by pressing the "M" button.

Peace!
